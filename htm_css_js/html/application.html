            <li> <b> Please make sure that:</b>

      <ul> <li>  you have an active user account at UiB. Log on to webmail.uib.no, miside.uib.no or another 
        UiB-service to see if your account is active.</li>
         <li> you remember the password for your UiB-account. If you have forgotten your password, you can change it at
         sebra.uib.no.</li></ul>
        l
        <li> If you are using your personal laptop, please make sure that you have installed the necessary software
             and programs before the examination day.  It is important that your laptop fulfils the system 
             requirements of the programme.</li>
       <li>You must bring your own power supply for use during the examination.</li> 
       <li> If failure to comply with these recommendations results in technical problems that cause a delay in
         your examination, you cannot expect to be granted extended time.</li>
      </li></ol>     
    
       <b> Before the examination starts</b>
       <ol> <li> Arrive at the examination venue at least 15 minutes before the start of the examination / 35 minutes
         before a digital examination.</li>
         <li> Law: The examination starts at the moment the book control begins, and you must therefore be present by
         8.20 a.m. for regular written examinations and 8.10 a.m. at digital examinations.</li>
         <li> When using a laptop at digital examinations, the laptop has to be set up as soon as possible. If you
             are taking a law exam, the laptop must be set up before the book control.</li>
       <li> Coats, backpacks, bags, etc. must be placed as directed. Mobile phones, mp3 players, smartwatches and other
         electronic devices must be turned off and put away, and cannot be stored in coats or pockets.</li>
       <li> If support material, other than that which is specifically permitted, is found at or by the desk,
         it may be treated as an attempt to cheat and relevant procedures for cheating will be followed. </li>
       <li>The head invigilator will provide information about examination support materials that you are permitted
         to use during the examination. All dictionaries must be approved by the faculty before the exam and will
          be handed out in the exam venue by the invigilators.</li>   
        </ol> 
        <b>During the examination</b> 
        <ol>
        <li> You are required to comply with the directions given by the head invigilator at the examination venue.</li>
        <li> Your student identity card or other valid photo identification must be visible on your desk during the
             entire examination (Student ID App with photo is not valid as identification).</li>
        <li> You may keep food and drink on or by the desk during the entire examination. You may eat and drink
             whenever you want.</li>
        <li> You are not permitted to leave the venue for a break before 9.30 a.m.   If you wish to withdraw from the
             examination, please note that you are not permitted to leave the venue before 10 a.m. at the earliest, 
             see below, Withdrawing from an examination.</li>
             <li> If anything in the examination question paper is unclear, you can contact the lecturer visiting the 
                venue. Such contact is facilitated by the head invigilator at the venue.</li>
       <li> Law: The student representatives do not represent the faculty, but if anything in the examination question paper is unclear the student representative at the venue can pass on the query to the right person(s) in charge.
        Papers and computer/laptop are to be covered when you leave your place.</li>
       <li> If you experience technical problems during a digital examination, you must immediately contact one of the
         invigilators. The invigilator will call for technical support. Failure to report such technical problems
          might be treated as cheating or an attempt to cheat. </li>                                    
    </ol>
         <b> Withdrawing from an examination</b>
         <ol> <li>
         You can withdraw from an examination, at the earliest, one hour after the examination has started.
          Contact the head invigilator and complete a withdrawal form. Withdrawals during an examination will be 
          treated as an examination attempt. You have to contact the head invigilator before you close down the
           examination programme at digital examination.</li>
          <li> If you fall ill during the examination and cannot complete it, you can withdraw from the examination.
          Contact the head invigilator and complete a withdrawal form. In order for an absence caused by illness 
          to be registered as legitimate absence, you must see a doctor immediately after leaving the examination
          venue. The doctor's certificate must be issued on the day of the examination and must identify 
           illness that arose during the examination. The doctor's certificate, possibly along with an application
            for a postponed examination, must be sent or submitted to the faculty in charge of the examination 
            within the deadlines set by the Faculty. It is your responsibility to apply to the Faculty and to 
            submit the relevant documentation and to assure you have the information about the deadlines that 
            apply. Withdrawal from an examination due to documented illness is not considered an examination 
            attempt. </li>
