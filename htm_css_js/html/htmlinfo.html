	<h3>what is html</h3>
	<p>HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.<br>

The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design

<h3>The History of HTML</h3>
<p>
<b>Hypertext</b><i> means</i> <u> the</u><strike> document</strike><tt>contains</tt><sup> links</sup><sab> that</sab> allow <ins>the reader</ins><del> to jump</del><big >to other</big><small> places</small><strong>in the document</strong> <mark> to another</mark><em> document altogether.</em><abbr> The latest </abbr><bdo>version is</bdo><q> known as HTML5.</q>
<blockquote>A Markup Language</blockquote><address> is a way that computers<br> speak to each other</address><cite> to control</cite><hr> how text </hr><pre>is processed and presented.</pre><center> To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.</center>
</p><hr>
<h3>What are Tags and Attributes?</h3>
<p>gs and attributes are the basis of HTML.

They work together but perform different functions â€“ it is worth investing 2 minutes in differentiating the two.
