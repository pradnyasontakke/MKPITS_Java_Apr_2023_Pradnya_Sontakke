    CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS,

          the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out,
           what background images or colors are used, layout designs,
        variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

    <p class="p2">CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can 
        define a style 
        for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.

        Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag.
         So less code means faster download times.
        Easy maintenance − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all 
        the web pages will be updated automatically.
        Superior styles to HTML − CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, 
        so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes. variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.
